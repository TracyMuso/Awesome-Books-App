## Awesome project

> In this project, I made a simple website called Awesome Books. The user is able to add and remove books, the added books are arranged in a list at the top of the page, removing books is also possible with one click. I used different modules with javascript classes to make these functions possible. I used simple html to set up the pages. There is a list page, add new book page and contact page.
